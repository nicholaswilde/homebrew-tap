## Input Context

- **Owner**: !{echo $OWNER:-nicholaswilde}

## Step 1: Metadata Discovery
1. Fetch repository details (description, homepage, license) from the GitHub API.
2. Fetch the latest release version and its assets.

## Step 2: Asset Analysis & Checksums
1. Identify assets for macOS (ARM64, x86_64) and Linux (ARM64, x86_64, ARMv6).
2. Download these assets and calculate their SHA256 checksums.

## Step 3: Formula Generation
1. Generate a new formula `.rb` file in the `Formula/` directory.
2. The class name should be a CamelCase version of the repository name.
3. Populate the formula with the discovered metadata, version, and platform-specific URLs and checksums.

## Step 4: Taskfile Integration
1. Add an individual audit task for the new formula to `Taskfile.yml`.
2. Update the unified `audit` task in `Taskfile.yml` to include the new formula's audit task.

## Step 5: README.md Integration
1. Add the new formula to the `Available Formulas` list in `README.md` in alphabetical order.
2. Ensure the entry includes a short description and emoji if applicable.

## Step 6: Final Report
- Summarize the created formula and the updates made to `Taskfile.yml` and `README.md`.
