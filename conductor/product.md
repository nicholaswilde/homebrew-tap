# Initial Concept
A personal Homebrew tap for hosting various tools.

# Product Definition - homebrew-tap

## Vision
A personal and community-accessible Homebrew tap designed to provide a centralized, reliable, and automated way to distribute and manage custom CLI tools.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** The developer (nicholaswilde) for seamless setup and synchronization of personal development environments across multiple machines.
- **Secondary:** Users of specific tools hosted here (e.g., `cook-docs`) who need a standard installation method on macOS or Linux.

## Core Goals
- **Centralized Management:** Serve as the single source of truth for the author's custom Homebrew formulas.
- **Cross-Platform Synchronization:** Ensure that personal tools can be easily installed and updated on any macOS or Linux machine.
- **Community Sharing:** Provide a stable and documented way for others to discover and use the tools developed by the author.

## Key Features & Guidelines
- **Automated Workflows:** Leverage tools like GoReleaser and GitHub Actions to automate the update process for formulas whenever new tool versions are released.
- **Multi-OS Support:** Maintain compatibility for both macOS (Intel/ARM) and Linux platforms.
- **Distribution Diversity:** Provide support for binary distributions for fast installation, while allowing for source-based builds where appropriate.
