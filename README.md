## :robot: Automation

This repository is configured to automatically audit, test, and update formulas. It utilizes custom Gemini commands to streamline maintenance:
- `add-formula`: Automates the creation of new formulas by fetching metadata and calculating checksums from GitHub.
- `update-formula`: Autonomously scans upstream repositories for new releases and updates formula versions and checksums.
