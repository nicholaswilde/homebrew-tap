# Agent CLI - Homebrew Tap Context

This file provides instructions and context for the Agent CLI when working on this repository.

## Project Structure
- `Formula/`: Contains Homebrew formula Ruby files (.rb).
- `.agents/conductor/`: Contains project management and tracking documents.

## Guidelines for Formula Updates
When updating formulas:
1.  **Maintain Style**: Adhere to the existing Ruby coding style and structure in the .rb files.
2.  **Version Consistency**: Ensure the `version` field matches the tag/release version exactly.
3.  **URL Mapping**: Verify that the download URLs are correctly constructed for each platform and architecture (e.g., macOS arm64 vs. Linux x86_64).
4.  **Checksums**: Always recalculate SHA256 checksums by downloading the assets. Do not guess or use old checksums.
5.  **Multi-Platform Support**: Most formulas in this tap support both macOS and Linux across multiple architectures. Ensure all relevant `on_macos` and `on_linux` blocks are updated.

## Automated Update Workflow
You are an automated Homebrew formula updater. Your goal is to keep formulas in the 'Formula/' directory up-to-date with their upstream GitHub releases.

1.  **Scan and Parse**: Identify the target formula(s). Read the `.rb` file(s) and identify the upstream GitHub repository from the `homepage` or `url` field.
2.  **Check for Updates**: For each formula, use the GitHub CLI (`gh release view --json tagName,assets`) or the GitHub API to find the latest stable release.
3.  **Compare Versions**: Compare the latest `tagName` (removing any 'v' prefix) with the `version` field in the formula. Proceed only if a newer version is available.
4.  **Update Assets**:
    a.  Identify the required assets for each platform and architecture (macOS/Linux, ARM/Intel). Make sure to check if separate assets exist for both `armv6` and `armv7` architectures (for example, `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` for armv6 and `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf` for armv7).
    b.  Download these assets and calculate their SHA256 checksums using `sha256sum`.
    c.  Update the `version` string at the top of the formula class.
    d.  Update the `url` and `sha256` strings within the `on_macos` and `on_linux` blocks, ensuring they match the correct hardware architecture (ARM vs Intel).
    e.  If both `armv6` and `armv7` release assets exist, update the 32-bit ARM Linux block (`Hardware::CPU.arm? && !Hardware::CPU.is_64_bit?`) to conditionally check `Utils.safe_popen_read("uname", "-m").include?("armv6")` and set the appropriate URL and SHA256 hash for each architecture.
    f.  If the installation path includes the version number (e.g., `bin.install "proxmox-mcp-rs-0.3.29-..."`), ensure those strings are also updated to the new version.
5.  **Maintain Integrity**: Ensure the Ruby syntax remains perfectly valid. Mimic the existing indentation and quote style.
6.  **Verify**: If possible, run `brew audit --strict <formula>` locally to ensure the updated formula is valid.

## Tool Usage
You have access to the shell. Use standard tools like `curl`, `sha256sum`, `gh` (GitHub CLI), and `uv` to perform your tasks.
1. When running the `gh` command, always use `rtk` and pipe to `cat` (e.g., `rtk gh release view --json tagName,assets | cat`) to filter output and prevent the CLI from hanging in interactive pagers.
2. For executing Python scripts in this repository, always use `uv run` (e.g., `uv run scripts/update_formula.py <formula_name>`) to ensure a consistent environment and dependency resolution.

## RTK (`rtk`) Command Proxy

Prefix raw shell commands with `rtk` whenever subcommand exists. `rtk` filters and compresses output before model context.

### Command Map

| Raw | Use |
|---|---|
| `git <cmd>` | `rtk git <cmd>` |
| `gh <cmd>` | `rtk gh <cmd> \| cat` |
| `rg` / `grep` | `rtk rg` / `rtk grep` |
| `ls` / `tree` / `find` | `rtk ls` / `rtk tree` / `rtk find` |
| `cat <file>` (to inspect) | `rtk read <file>` |
| `diff` | `rtk diff` |
| `wc` | `rtk wc` |
| tests / checks (`task audit:*`) | `rtk test <cmd>` or `rtk err <cmd>` |
| build / lint (`task lint`) | `rtk err <cmd>` |
| noisy output | `rtk summary <cmd>` |

### Exceptions

1. **ctx sandbox**: inside `ctx_execute` / `ctx_batch_execute`, skip `rtk`; only printed output enters context.
2. **Exact output needed**: drop `rtk` when raw bytes matter (`git diff` patch, verbatim file edit).
3. **No subcommand**: run commands without `rtk` subcommand raw (`mkdir`, `rm`, `uv run`).
4. **Unknown**: check `rtk --help` before assuming subcommand exists.

<!-- context-mode-begin -->
## Context-Mode Routing Guidelines
- **Derive, Do Not Dump**: Do NOT use `ctx_execute_file` or `ctx_execute` to dump whole file or full config. Print only specific value, matches, count, or known line range needed.
- **Tool Call Surface**: When using MCP wrappers, call `call_mcp_tool` with `ServerName: "context-mode_context-mode"` (or `"context-mode"`) and `ToolName: "ctx_execute"`, `"ctx_execute_file"`, `"ctx_batch_execute"`, `"ctx_fetch_and_index"`, `"ctx_search"`, or `"ctx_index"`.
- **Mandatory Routing**:
  - For analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform tasks, write code with `ctx_execute` and print only final answer.
  - For analyzing/exploring inside file, use `ctx_execute_file`. Use native `read_file` only when editing requires exact bytes or small known range.
  - Use `ctx_batch_execute` for multi-command repository reconnaissance.
  - Use `ctx_execute` for shell commands whose output may exceed short fixed answer.
  - Use `ctx_fetch_and_index` for web content, then `ctx_search` to query it.
  - Return only derived answers, concise summaries, selected snippets, or file paths.

<!-- ponytail-begin -->
## Ponytail (Lazy Senior Dev Mode) Guidelines
- **Stop at the first rung that holds**:
  1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI)
  2. Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse existing helpers/utils/patterns.
  3. Does the standard library already do this?
  4. Does a native platform feature cover it?
  5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it?
  6. Can this be one line?
  7. Only then: write the minimum code that works.
- **Bug fix = root cause, not symptom**: Fix the shared function/path rather than individual callers.
- **Rules**:
  - No unrequested abstractions, boilerplate, or avoidable dependencies.
  - Deletion over addition. Boring over clever. Fewest files possible.
  - Shortest working diff wins, once the problem is understood.
  - Mark deliberate simplifications cutting a real corner with a `ponytail:` comment naming the ceiling and upgrade path.
  - Ensure logic leaves behind ONE runnable check (assert-based demo/self-check or small test file; no frameworks/fixtures). Trivial one-liners need no test.

<!-- caveman-begin -->
## Caveman Guidelines
Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stay. Only fluff die.

Rules:
- Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging
- Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Technical terms exact. Code unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
- Not: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that."
- Yes: "Bug in auth middleware. Fix:"

Switch level: /caveman lite|full|ultra|wenyan
Stop: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

Auto-Clarity: drop caveman for security warnings, irreversible actions, user confused. Resume after.

Boundaries: code/commits/PRs written normal.

<!-- codegraph-begin -->
## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.

<!-- serena-begin -->
## Serena Semantic Code Tools

Serena MCP provides Language Server Protocol (LSP) backed semantic coding tools, token-efficient AST symbol search, reference-aware refactoring, and persistent project memories.

- **Project Activation**: When Serena is available, ensure the workspace is active before querying code. If Serena returns `No active project`, call `activate_project` with the project root directory.
- **Symbol Inspection Over File Dumps**: Do not dump entire source code files into context. Use `get_symbols_overview` for a high-level view of symbols in a file, or `find_symbol` to retrieve specific classes, functions, or methods with their bodies.
- **Pattern & Reference Search**: Use `search_for_pattern` to locate symbols when the exact path is unknown, and `find_referencing_symbols` to analyze blast radius and callers.
- **Atomic Refactoring**: Prefer Serena's reference-aware editing tools (`rename_symbol`, `safe_delete_symbol`, `replace_symbol_body`) over manual regex or line-based text edits when refactoring existing symbols.
- **Persistent Memory**: Use `read_memory`, `write_memory`, and `list_memories` to retrieve or store durable project facts and conventions across agent sessions.
- **Diagnostics**: Use `get_diagnostics_for_file` to inspect LSP compiler/linter warnings and errors on modified files.

<!-- headroom-begin -->
## Headroom MCP (Context Window Compression)
Use Headroom (`headroom`) MCP tools to manage context window consumption on large payloads:
- `headroom_compress`: Shrink large tool outputs or raw data.
- `headroom_retrieve`: Retrieve original content by hash if specific details needed.
- `headroom_stats`: Monitor headroom cache usage.
<!-- headroom-end -->

<!-- ripgrep-guidelines-begin -->
## Ripgrep Guidelines
- **Pattern Searching**: Always use `rg` (ripgrep) or `rtk rg` instead of standard `grep` to search text inside files quickly and save token output.
- **Scope**: Use `-t rb` for Ruby files, `-t py` for Python files, `-l` for file listing, keep context small (`-C 1`).
<!-- ripgrep-guidelines-end -->

<!-- taplo-rules-begin -->
## Taplo TOML Rules
- **Format**: Run `taplo fmt` to format TOML files in-place (`pyproject.toml`).
- **Validation**: Run `taplo lint` to validate TOML syntax and schema.

<!-- issue-management-begin -->
## GitHub Issue Management
- GitHub issues only close automatically when commits containing `Fixes #<number>` are pushed to remote repository.
<!-- issue-management-end -->

<!-- sensitive-information-protection-begin -->
## Sensitive Information & Secret Protection
NEVER commit or stage sensitive personal, financial, or security data to repository:
1. **Secrets & Credentials**: Never commit `.env` files, API keys, bearer tokens, passwords, or private encryption keys.
2. **Explicit Staging**: Never use `git add .` when untracked secret files exist; stage explicitly by name.
